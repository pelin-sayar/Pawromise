A Java project for my high school CS Data Structures class. (The adoptableDogs.txt file is an example file for the purpose of testing the code)

Description: Humans measure their compatibility with other humans before a serious commitment. So why shouldnâ€™t we measure our compatibility 
with specific pets before jumping at their flattering appearance? Whether it be time, other pets, or financial barriers, the number one reason pets
are surrendered to animal shelters is their incompatibility with their adopter. My program matches adopters with pets based off on their 
preferences - Pawromising a great match.

Future improvements: Some future improvements for my program is to turn it into a website where adopters and animal shelters/adoption centers can make
corresponding accounts where they can add information about themselves.
